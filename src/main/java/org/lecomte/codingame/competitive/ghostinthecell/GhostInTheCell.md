# Ghost In the Cell

## Changes

### Version 1.0
Take the first friendly factory in the list and send all troups to the first enemy factory

## Ideas

1. Ignore factories that don't produce any cyborgs.
They are useless (for now), and the cyborgs I'll use to take these factories 
(by fighting enemy or neutral cyborgs) will be lost.

2. Use the factory where I have the most cyborgs to send troops from.
We want to avoid sending too few troops (or even 0) every turn while there are dozens
of cyborgs sleeping in another factory.

3. Focus on the closest factories first
We want to take new factories and start producing new cyborgs as soon as possible.
